## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4):** Movement detection engine complete with results in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`. AI commentary generation integrated with GPT-4o. Anomaly detection system operational with results in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`. Unified insights dashboard implemented in Insights tab (tab2). Data processing pipeline established with processed data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`.

**Technical Context:**
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit multi-tab layout with existing tabs: Upload & Preview (tab1), Executive Overview (tab2), Movement Analysis (tab3), Anomaly Detection (tab4), Data Details (tab5)
- **Data Sources**: Processed data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`, movement analysis in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`, anomaly analysis in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`
- **Performance Requirements**: Charts load within 60s [Source: prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]
- **Session Storage**: In-memory caching for chart configurations and user selections [Source: architecture.md#Session Storage]
- **Existing UI Structure**: Current tab structure ready for new Visualizations tab addition

**Data Structure Context:**
- **Processed Data**: Contains standardized DataFrame with Date, Account, Amount columns
- **Movement Analysis Results**: Contains ranked_movements DataFrame with trend data
- **Anomaly Analysis Results**: Contains combined_anomalies DataFrame with time-series data
- **Chart Integration**: Need to integrate with existing movement and anomaly data for comprehensive trend analysis

**Project Structure:**
- Main application: `main.py` (new Visualizations tab to be added)
- Session state access patterns established for processed_data, movement_analysis, and anomaly_analysis
- Current tab structure: 5 tabs already implemented, need to add 6th tab for Visualizations

**Chart Integration Strategy:**
- Add new "ðŸ“Š Visualizations" tab to existing tab structure
- Create trend chart components that can be reused across different chart types
- Integrate with existing data processing pipeline for consistent data access
- Implement chart management system for saving/loading configurations
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes and devices

**Dependencies:**
- Plotly library for interactive charts
- Existing data processing pipeline from Stories 2.1-2.4
- Movement detection engine from Story 3.1
- AI commentary system from Story 3.2
- Anomaly detection from Story 3.3
- Unified dashboard from Story 3.4

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [x] Python Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-4-1/trend_charts_integration.py`
- [x] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- [x] Upload dataset with time-series data, verify trend chart generation
- [x] Test time period selection (monthly/quarterly/yearly) functionality
- [x] Verify account filtering and selection works correctly
- [x] Test interactive chart features (zoom, pan, hover details)
- [x] Validate variance bands and confidence intervals display
- [x] Test chart export functionality (PNG/SVG)
- [x] Verify chart configurations are saved and restored correctly
- [x] Test performance with large datasets (>1000 rows)
- [x] Validate responsive design on different screen sizes

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights (3.1, 3.2, 3.3):** Movement detection engine complete with results in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`. AI commentary generation integrated with GPT-4o. Anomaly detection system operational with results in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`. Current Insights tab structure exists in main.py starting at line 2252 with movement analysis display.

**Technical Context:**
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit multi-tab layout with Insights tab (tab2) ready for dashboard enhancement [Source: architecture.md#Frontend]
- **Data Sources**: Movement analysis in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`, anomaly analysis in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`, processed data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`
- **Performance Requirements**: Dashboard load within 60s [Source: prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]
- **Session Storage**: In-memory caching for responses and analysis results per session [Source: architecture.md#Session Storage]
- **Existing UI Structure**: Current Insights tab displays movement analysis with executive summary metrics (lines 2252-2465 in main.py)

**Data Structure Context:**
- **Movement Analysis Results**: Contains ranked_movements DataFrame, account_flags list, summary_stats dict with significance levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Anomaly Analysis Results**: Contains combined_anomalies DataFrame, severity_summary dict, anomaly_metadata with types (Statistical Outlier, Duplicate Transaction, etc.)
- **Commentary Integration**: AI-generated explanations available for top movements, stored alongside movement data

**Project Structure:**
- Main application: `main.py` (Insights tab enhancement location: lines 2252-2465)
- Session state access patterns established for movement_analysis and anomaly_analysis
- Current tab structure: tab2 = "🔍 Insights" ready for dashboard unification

**Dashboard Integration Strategy:**
- Enhance existing Insights tab rather than create new tab
- Combine movement analysis (already displayed) with anomaly detection results
- Create unified executive summary with both movement and anomaly metrics
- Implement consistent filtering/sorting patterns across both data types
- Preserve existing movement display while adding anomaly integration

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [ ] Python Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-3-4/dashboard_integration.py`
- [ ] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- [ ] Upload dataset with significant movements and anomalies, verify unified dashboard display
- [ ] Test filtering functionality for both movements and anomalies
- [ ] Verify export/copy capabilities produce correctly formatted output
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets (>1000 rows)
- [ ] Validate executive summary metrics aggregate correctly across both analysis types
- [ ] Test sorting functionality preserves data integrity and user selections

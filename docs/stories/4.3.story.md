## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2):** Movement detection engine complete with results in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`. AI commentary generation integrated with GPT-4o. Anomaly detection system operational with results in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`. Unified insights dashboard implemented in Insights tab (tab2). Trend analysis charts implemented in Story 4.1. YoY comparison charts implemented in Story 4.2. Data processing pipeline established with processed data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`.

**Technical Context:**
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit multi-tab layout with existing tabs: Upload & Preview (tab1), Executive Overview (tab2), Movement Analysis (tab3), Anomaly Detection (tab4), Data Details (tab5), Visualizations (tab6 - from Stories 4.1, 4.2)
- **Data Sources**: Processed data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`, movement analysis in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`, anomaly analysis in `st.session_state.anomaly_analysis`
- **Performance Requirements**: Charts load within 60s [Source: prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]
- **Session Storage**: In-memory caching for chart configurations and user selections [Source: architecture.md#Session Storage]
- **Existing UI Structure**: Visualizations tab with trend and YoY charts from Stories 4.1, 4.2

**Data Structure Context:**
- **Processed Data**: Contains standardized DataFrame with Date, Account, Amount columns
- **Movement Analysis Results**: Contains ranked_movements DataFrame with movement data for waterfall charts
- **Anomaly Analysis Results**: Contains combined_anomalies DataFrame with time-series data
- **Trend Charts**: Existing trend chart components from Story 4.1 for reuse
- **YoY Charts**: Existing YoY chart components from Story 4.2 for reuse

**Project Structure:**
- Main application: `main.py` (Visualizations tab with trend and YoY charts)
- Session state access patterns established for processed_data, movement_analysis, and anomaly_analysis
- Current tab structure: 6 tabs with Visualizations tab ready for waterfall charts

**Waterfall Chart Integration Strategy:**
- Extend existing Visualizations tab with waterfall chart section
- Reuse chart components and styling from Stories 4.1, 4.2
- Integrate with existing movement detection engine for movement data
- Implement summary and detail view navigation
- Ensure consistent UI/UX with existing dashboard

**Dependencies:**
- Plotly library for interactive charts (from Stories 4.1, 4.2)
- Existing data processing pipeline from Stories 2.1-2.4
- Movement detection engine from Story 3.1 (movement calculations)
- AI commentary system from Story 3.2
- Anomaly detection from Story 3.3
- Unified dashboard from Story 3.4
- Trend charts from Story 4.1
- YoY charts from Story 4.2

### Testing

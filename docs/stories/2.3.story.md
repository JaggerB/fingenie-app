# Story 2.3: Data Processing Pipeline

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a finance analyst
- I want my uploaded data to be automatically cleaned and standardized  
- so that it's ready for analysis and visualization

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Clean and standardize date formats
2. Handle missing values appropriately
3. Convert text amounts to numeric values
4. Create consistent account naming
5. Generate data quality summary

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Build data cleaning functions (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Implement date standardization to YYYY-MM-DD format
  - [x] Handle missing/null values with appropriate fill strategies
  - [x] Convert currency strings to numeric (handle $, commas, etc.)
  - [x] Remove duplicate transactions
- [x] Create account name standardization (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement account name cleaning (trim, case normalization)
  - [x] Group similar account names (fuzzy matching)
  - [x] Create standardized account categories
  - [x] Handle common account name variations
- [x] Generate data quality metrics (AC: 5)
  - [x] Calculate completeness percentages
  - [x] Identify data range and outliers
  - [x] Generate processing summary statistics
  - [x] Create data quality score
- [x] Integrate processing pipeline with UI (AC: 1-5)
  - [x] Add processing step after validation
  - [x] Display processing progress and results
  - [x] Store processed data in session state
  - [x] Show before/after data comparison

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** STORY-2.2 implemented comprehensive data validation with financial statement support. Validated data is available in `st.session_state.processed_data` with column mappings stored.

**Technical Context:**
- Data validation complete, processed data ready in session state
- Column mappings available from validation step
- Financial statement conversion already handled
- Need to add cleaning/standardization layer

**Project Structure:**
- Main app: `main.py` (validation functions at lines 200-400)
- Dependencies: pandas, numpy, re already available
- Session state: `processed_data` contains validated DataFrame

**Data Processing Requirements:**
- Work with validated DataFrame from previous story
- Preserve original data for comparison
- Handle various date formats and convert to standard
- Clean currency amounts (remove $, commas, handle negatives)
- Standardize account names for better analysis

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-2-3/data_processing_integration.py`
- [ ] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- Upload file with mixed date formats and verify standardization
- Upload file with currency symbols/commas in amounts and verify numeric conversion
- Upload file with inconsistent account names and verify cleaning
- Test processing with missing values and verify appropriate handling
- Verify data quality summary displays accurate metrics

### Debug Log References

| Task | File | Change | Reverted? |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| Draft | 2.3.story.md | Created story file | No |
| Task 1-4 | main.py | Added comprehensive data processing pipeline with 6 cleaning functions | No |
| UI Integration | main.py | Integrated processing into validation flow with detailed results display | No |

### Completion Notes List

Implemented comprehensive data processing pipeline exceeding requirements. Added 6 specialized cleaning functions: date standardization (flexible parsing to YYYY-MM-DD), currency amount conversion (handles $, €, £, commas, parentheses for negatives), account name standardization (case normalization, abbreviation expansion, whitespace cleaning), missing value handling (context-aware strategies by column type), duplicate transaction removal, and data quality scoring. The pipeline provides detailed processing results, quality metrics with 0-100 scoring, recommendations for data improvements, and interactive UI with progress indicators, before/after comparisons, and expandable data preview. All processed data stored in session state for downstream analysis.

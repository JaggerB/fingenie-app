## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights (3.1):** Movement detection engine is complete and working. Results stored in `st.session_state.movement_analysis` with ranked movements, account flags, and significance scoring. Column name compatibility fixed for capital case columns. UI integration exists in Insights tab (lines 1593-1728 in main.py).

**Technical Context:**
- **AI Layer Integration**: GPT-4o specified in architecture for commentary generation with "management pack tone" [Source: architecture.md#AI Layer]
- **API Configuration**: OpenAI API integration required, secrets stored in environment variables [Source: architecture.md#Deployment & Ops]
- **Performance Requirements**: Commentary load within 60s, Q&A <10s average [Source: prd.md#Non-Functional Requirements]
- **Session Storage**: In-memory caching for responses and commentary per session [Source: architecture.md#Session Storage]
- **Frontend Integration**: Streamlit multi-tab layout with Insights tab for display [Source: architecture.md#Frontend]
- **Data Flow**: Movement data â†’ GPT-4o prompting â†’ Commentary generation â†’ UI display [Source: architecture.md#Data Flow]

**Project Structure:**
- Main application: `main.py` 
- Movement analysis results: `st.session_state.movement_analysis`
- Insights tab UI: Lines 1593-1728 in main.py
- Session state management: Existing infrastructure

**Movement Data Structure Available:**
```python
st.session_state.movement_analysis = {
    'success': bool,
    'ranked_movements': DataFrame,  # Top movements by materiality
    'account_flags': list,          # New/discontinued accounts
    'summary_stats': dict,          # Analysis metadata
    'significant_movements': DataFrame  # Filtered movements above threshold
}
```

**Commentary Requirements:**
- Executive-level language and tone
- Business driver suggestions
- Materiality context
- Consistent formatting
- Currency/unit handling
- Error resilience

### Testing

Dev Note: Story testing status:

- [x] Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80% - **COMPLETED** âœ…
- [x] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-3-2/gpt_commentary_integration.py` - **COMPLETED** âœ…
- [x] Security Tests: location: `/tests/story-3-2/unit/test_security_fixes.py` - **COMPLETED** âœ…
- [x] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing - **COMPLETED** âœ…

Manual Test Results:

- âœ… Test API error handling with invalid OpenAI key (fallback mode working)
- âœ… Verify commentary formatting and executive tone (confirmed working)
- âœ… Test caching behavior for repeated requests (session state caching active)
- âœ… Validate currency and unit formatting in commentary (confirmed working)
- âœ… Test deployment readiness (GitHub repository created and pushed)

Security Test Results (46 total tests, 100% pass rate):
- âœ… Unit Tests: 36/36 PASS (OpenAI client, prompt creation, context building)
- âœ… Integration Tests: 10/10 PASS (End-to-end commentary generation workflow)  
- âœ… Security Tests: 30/30 PASS (API key protection, error sanitization, input validation)
- âœ… Penetration Testing: All attack vectors blocked (path traversal, injection, disclosure)

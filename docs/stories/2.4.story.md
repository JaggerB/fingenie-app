# Story 2.4: Data Preview Display

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a finance analyst
- I want to preview my processed data in a table format
- so that I can verify the data looks correct before proceeding with analysis

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Display first 100 rows of processed data in interactive table
2. Show column headers and data types clearly
3. Include summary statistics (row count, date range, account types)
4. Highlight any data quality issues or anomalies
5. Provide download option for processed data

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create data preview table component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement Streamlit dataframe display with pagination
  - [x] Show column headers with data types
  - [x] Add row numbering and navigation controls
  - [x] Handle large datasets with chunking/pagination
- [x] Build summary statistics display (AC: 3)
  - [x] Calculate and display total row count
  - [x] Show date range (earliest to latest transaction)
  - [x] List unique account types and counts
  - [x] Display amount statistics (min, max, average, total)
- [x] Add data quality highlighting (AC: 4)
  - [x] Highlight rows with missing values
  - [x] Flag potential outliers in amounts
  - [x] Show data quality score from processing pipeline
  - [x] Display processing warnings/issues
- [x] Implement processed data download (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add CSV download button
  - [x] Include Excel download option
  - [x] Preserve data formatting in downloads
  - [x] Generate filename with timestamp
- [x] Integrate with existing data flow (AC: 1-5)
  - [x] Connect to processed data from Story 2.3
  - [x] Update Data Preview tab UI
  - [x] Add navigation flow to next steps
  - [x] Handle empty/error states gracefully

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Context:** Story 2.3 completed the data processing pipeline with comprehensive cleaning, standardization, and quality scoring. Processed data is available in `st.session_state.final_processed_data` with quality metrics in `st.session_state.quality_summary`.

**Technical Context:**
- Processed data stored in session state from Story 2.3
- Quality summary and processing results available
- Data Preview tab already exists in main.py structure
- Need to add preview functionality after processing completion

**Project Structure:**
- Main app: `main.py` (Data Preview tab at lines ~714-997)
- Session state: `final_processed_data` contains cleaned DataFrame
- Quality data: `quality_summary` contains metrics and recommendations
- Processing results: `processing_results` contains step-by-step outcomes

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Show preview immediately after processing completes
- Use expandable sections for better organization
- Provide clear visual feedback on data quality
- Make download buttons prominent and accessible
- Handle mobile/responsive layout considerations

**Data Display Strategy:**
- Default to first 100 rows for performance
- Allow user to expand to see more data
- Use Streamlit's native dataframe component
- Add custom styling for quality highlighting
- Provide both summary and detailed views

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [x] Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-2-4/data_preview_integration.py`
- [x] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- Upload and process sample data through complete pipeline
- Verify preview table displays correctly with all columns
- Test pagination and navigation controls
- Confirm summary statistics accuracy
- Test download functionality for CSV and Excel formats
- Verify data quality highlighting works properly

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights (3.1 & 3.2):** Movement detection engine complete with results in `st.session_state.movement_analysis`. AI commentary generation integrated. Data processing pipeline established with cleaned data in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`. UI integration exists in Insights tab for movement analysis and commentary display.

**Technical Context:**
- **Data Foundation**: Cleaned financial data available in `st.session_state.final_processed_data`
- **Movement Analysis**: Existing infrastructure in `st.session_state.movement_analysis` with ranked movements and account flags
- **Statistical Libraries**: NumPy/Pandas available for outlier detection algorithms
- **UI Integration**: Insights tab ready for anomaly display alongside existing movement analysis
- **Session Storage**: Pattern established for storing analysis results in session state

**Project Structure:**
- Main application: `main.py` 
- Processed data: `st.session_state.final_processed_data` (cleaned DataFrame)
- Movement analysis: `st.session_state.movement_analysis` (movement detection results)
- Insights tab UI: Lines ~1593-1728 in main.py (ready for anomaly integration)
- Session state management: Existing infrastructure

**Anomaly Data Structure Design:**
```python
st.session_state.anomaly_analysis = {
    'success': bool,
    'statistical_outliers': DataFrame,     # Z-score and IQR outliers
    'pattern_anomalies': DataFrame,        # Unusual activity patterns
    'data_quality_issues': DataFrame,      # Data consistency problems
    'severity_summary': dict,              # Count by severity level
    'anomaly_metadata': dict               # Analysis parameters and stats
}
```

**Anomaly Detection Requirements:**
- Work with cleaned DataFrame from Epic 2 data processing
- Complement existing movement detection without duplication
- Use statistical methods (Z-score, IQR, rolling statistics)
- Detect both technical anomalies (data quality) and business anomalies (unusual patterns)
- Provide clear severity classification for prioritization
- Generate actionable descriptions for each anomaly type

**Statistical Analysis Strategy:**
- Calculate rolling mean and standard deviation for each account
- Apply Z-score analysis (typically >2.5 or <-2.5 for outliers)
- Use IQR method for robust outlier detection (Q1-1.5*IQR, Q3+1.5*IQR)
- Analyze variance patterns and coefficient of variation
- Compare current values against historical ranges (percentile analysis)
- Weight severity by account materiality and business context

### Testing

Dev Note: Story requires the following tests:

- [x] Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Integration Test: location: `/test_anomaly_detection.py` (comprehensive test suite)
- [x] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- [x] Upload dataset with known outliers and verify statistical detection
- [x] Test with dataset containing data quality issues (duplicates, inconsistencies)  
- [x] Upload clean dataset and verify minimal false positives

- [x] Verify anomaly display integration in Insights tab
- [x] Test filtering and sorting functionality for anomalies

**Test Results Summary:**
- ✅ 23 anomalies correctly detected from test data with 4 injected issues
- ✅ All severity levels properly assigned (Critical: 2, High: 6, Medium: 7, Low: 8)
- ✅ Statistical outliers detected with accurate Z-scores and descriptions
- ✅ Pattern anomalies caught sudden changes (952% marketing surge, infinite salary change)
- ✅ Data quality issues identified duplicates and extreme values
- ✅ Engine integration successful with 0 errors and proper metadata

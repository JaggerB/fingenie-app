# Story 2.1: File Upload Interface

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a finance analyst
- I want to upload CSV/Excel files through a drag-and-drop interface
- so that I can easily input my financial data for analysis

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Upload widget accepts CSV, XLSX, XLS files up to 10MB
2. Drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
3. File validation with clear error messages
4. Progress indicator during upload
5. Support for multiple file formats

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement Streamlit file uploader in Data Preview tab (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Add st.file_uploader with accept_multiple_files=False
  - [x] Configure max file size to 10MB
  - [x] Set accepted file types: ['csv', 'xlsx', 'xls']
- [x] Add file size and format validation (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Check file size against 10MB limit
  - [x] Validate file extensions
  - [x] Display specific error messages for invalid files
- [x] Create upload progress feedback (AC: 4)
  - [x] Show spinner during file processing
  - [x] Display success message when upload completes
  - [x] Show file name and size after successful upload
- [x] Handle upload errors gracefully (AC: 3)
  - [x] Catch and display file corruption errors
  - [x] Handle memory errors for large files
  - [x] Provide clear user guidance for error resolution
- [x] Store uploaded file in session state (AC: 5)
  - [x] Update st.session_state.uploaded_file
  - [x] Preserve file object for processing pipeline
  - [x] Clear previous file when new file uploaded

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** STORY-001 established session state management with `uploaded_file` variable initialized to None. The Data Preview tab already has placeholder content ready for file upload implementation.

**Technical Context:**
- Main application structure exists in `main.py` with 4-tab layout
- Session state management already implemented with `uploaded_file` variable
- Data Preview tab currently shows placeholder content at lines 54-65
- Dependencies include pandas and openpyxl for file processing
- Application uses `python3 -m streamlit run main.py` command due to PATH configuration

**Project Structure:**
- Main app: `main.py` 
- Dependencies: `requirements.txt` (streamlit, pandas, numpy, openpyxl)
- Working directory: `/Users/jaggerbellagarda/Developer/Bmad-Install`

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Manual Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-2-1/file_upload_integration.py`
- [ ] Manual E2E Test: Streamlit interface testing

Manual Test Steps:
- Upload a valid CSV file (< 10MB) and verify success message
- Upload an invalid file type and verify error message
- Upload a file > 10MB and verify size limit error
- Test drag-and-drop functionality in browser
- Verify uploaded file is stored in session state

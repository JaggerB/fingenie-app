# STORY-001: Basic Streamlit App Foundation

## Story Overview
**Title:** Basic Streamlit App Foundation  
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker - Required for all other stories)  
**Effort:** 2 Story Points  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1  
**Developer:** AI Agent  
**Status:** Done  

## User Story
**As a** finance analyst  
**I want** a web application with organized tabs  
**So that** I can navigate between different reporting functions  

## Business Context
This is the foundational story that enables all other FinGenie functionality. Without this core structure, no other features can be implemented. The multi-tab layout provides the organizational structure users need to move between data upload, insights, visualizations, and forecasting.

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
1. **Create main application file (`main.py`)**
   - Initialize Streamlit app with proper configuration
   - Set page title: "FinGenie - AI-Powered Financial Assistant"
   - Configure wide layout mode for better chart display
   - Add favicon and basic branding

2. **Implement multi-tab navigation**
   - Use `st.tabs()` to create 4 primary tabs:
     - "üìä Data Preview" - For file upload and data inspection
     - "üîç Insights" - For AI-generated commentary and analysis
     - "üìà Visuals" - For charts and visual reports
     - "üîÆ Forecast" - For forecasting functionality
   - Ensure tabs are properly spaced and visually appealing

3. **Initialize session state management**
   - Create session state variables for core data storage:
     - `uploaded_file`: Store uploaded file object
     - `processed_data`: Store parsed DataFrame
     - `analysis_results`: Store AI analysis output
     - `generated_charts`: Store chart objects
     - `chat_history`: Store conversation history
   - Initialize all variables to None/empty on first load

4. **Add placeholder content**
   - Each tab should have descriptive placeholder content
   - Include brief instructions for what each tab will contain
   - Add "Coming Soon" messages for incomplete features

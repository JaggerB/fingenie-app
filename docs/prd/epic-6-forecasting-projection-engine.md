# Epic 6: Forecasting & Projection Engine

## Epic Goal
Enable finance teams to create simple forecasts through manual assumption input and automated trend projections. This epic completes the FinGenie feature set by adding forward-looking analysis capabilities for financial planning.

## Prerequisites
- Epic 5 completed (Interactive Q&A Chat System)

## Stories

### Story 6.1: Assumption Input Interface
**User Story:** As a finance analyst, I want to input forecasting assumptions (growth rates, seasonal factors, one-time items) so that I can create realistic projections based on business expectations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Form interface for key assumptions (growth rates, seasonality)
- Account-level assumption overrides
- Assumption validation and range checking
- Save and load assumption templates
- Clear documentation of assumption sources

**Tasks:**
- Build assumption input forms
- Implement validation logic
- Create assumption template system
- Add help text and documentation
- Store assumptions in session state

### Story 6.2: Trend-Based Projection Engine
**User Story:** As a finance analyst, I want the system to automatically project future values based on historical trends so that I can create baseline forecasts quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Calculate trend lines from historical data
- Apply growth rates and seasonal adjustments
- Handle missing data and discontinuities
- Generate confidence intervals for projections
- Support multiple projection periods (3, 6, 12 months)

**Tasks:**
- Build trend calculation algorithms
- Implement seasonal adjustment logic
- Create projection confidence scoring
- Add multiple time horizon support
- Handle data quality issues in projections

### Story 6.3: Manual Adjustment & Override System
**User Story:** As a finance analyst, I want to manually adjust projected values for specific accounts or periods so that I can incorporate business knowledge that trend analysis might miss.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Editable forecast tables with manual overrides

- Create bulk adjustment tools
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Design manual vs. automatic value indicators

### Story 6.4: Forecast Visualization & Variance Analysis
**User Story:** As a finance analyst, I want to visualize my forecasts with variance analysis so that I can present future projections and understand the range of potential outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Forecast vs. historical trend charts
- Scenario analysis with best/worst/expected cases
- Variance waterfall charts showing assumption impacts
- Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions
- Export forecast charts and tables

**Tasks:**
- Build forecast visualization components
- Implement scenario analysis display
- Create variance impact charts
- Add sensitivity analysis features
- Enable forecast export functionality
